StandardScaler is a preprocessing technique used to scale features such that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It's particularly useful when the features in the dataset have different scales or units, ensuring that all features contribute equally to the analysis. Here's how it works:

Initialization:

Initialize the StandardScaler object.
Fit scaler to data:

Compute the mean and standard deviation for each feature (column) in the dataset. These statistics will be used to scale the data.
Transform data:

Apply the scaling transformation to the data. For each feature, the transformation is given by:
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
=
�
−
�
�
x 
scaled
​
 = 
σ
x−μ
​
 
where 
�
x is the original value of the feature, 
�
μ is the mean of the feature, and 
�
σ is the standard deviation of the feature.
Now, let's discuss the provided code:

Sample Data:

data = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6], [4, 8]]): This defines a numpy array containing sample data with 4 samples and 2 features each.
Initializing StandardScaler:

scaler = StandardScaler(): This initializes a StandardScaler object.
Fit scaler to data and transform data:

scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data): This fits the StandardScaler to the data and transforms the data using the computed mean and standard deviation for each feature.
Printing Scaled Data:

print("Scaled Data:")
print(scaled_data): This prints the scaled version of the original data.
The resulting scaled_data contains the scaled version of the original data, where each feature's values are transformed to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This scaling is applied independently to each feature, preserving the relative relationships between feature values.
