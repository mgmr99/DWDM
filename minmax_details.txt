MinMaxScaler is a preprocessing technique used to scale features to a specified range, typically between 0 and 1. It is particularly useful when the features have different scales or units, ensuring that all features contribute equally to the analysis. Here's how it works:

Initialization:

Initialize the MinMaxScaler object.
Fit scaler to data:

Compute the minimum and maximum values for each feature (column) in the dataset. These values will be used to scale the data.
Transform data:

Apply the scaling transformation to the data. For each feature, the transformation is given by:
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
=

−

​
 −x 
min
​
 
x−x 
min
​
 
​
 
where 
�
�
�
�
x 
min
​
  is the minimum value of the feature, 
�
�
�
�
x 
max
​
  is the maximum value of the feature, and 
�
x is the original value of the feature.
Now, let's discuss the provided code:

Sample Data:

data = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6], [4, 8]]): This defines a numpy array containing sample data with 4 samples and 2 features each.
Initializing MinMaxScaler:

scaler = MinMaxScaler(): This initializes a MinMaxScaler object.
Fit scaler to data and transform data:

scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data): This fits the MinMaxScaler to the data and transforms the data using the computed minimum and maximum values for each feature.
Printing Scaled Data:

print("Scaled Data:")
print(scaled_data): This prints the scaled version of the original data.
The resulting scaled_data contains the scaled version of the original data, where each feature's values are transformed to lie within the range [0, 1]. This scaling is applied independently to each feature, preserving the relative relationships between feature values.
